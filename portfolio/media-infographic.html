        <h2>About the project</h2>
        <p>Cultural appropriation is a very divisive topic; however, I believe that much of its controversy arises out of fundamental misunderstandings about what exactly entails cultural appropriation. For the final project of my MEDIA 180 class, I chose to create
        an infographic that provides a clear and concise explanation of the issue. The infographic takes advantage of visual hierarchy to help readers understand the general thrust of the content even before they read the text.</p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>As anyone endeavoring to create an infographic without any prior graphic design experience would do, I watched a few intro to graphic design courses on <a href="http://lynda.com">Lynda</a>.</p>
        <p>Thorough research was conducted to get a sense of what kinds of actions were targeted as culturally appropriative, the impacts that these actions had (whether on individuals or society at large), and arguments from several sides of the debate on whether cultural appropriation is permittable. The titles of the three infographic cards were chosen based off of which parts of the topic possibly generated the most confusion: what is cultural appropriation, what are some examples of it, and how to identify and respond to it.</p>
        <p>One guiding principle for the design was to use highly visible items to summarize or emphasize important points. For instance, in the first card, I opted to use the equation "culture + appropration = cultural appropriation" to visually communicate a simple definition of the topic.</p>
        <p>The infographic argues that, intentional or not, cultural appropriation is an offensive behavior. I chose to highlight two potential (and common) counter-arguments to these positions in the form of yellow text bubbles, deliberately contrasted with the main content in green or off-black. However, I do wish I had done a better job of visually indicating that I believe these positions are misinformed. By merely placing them at the end of the infographics, they don't do anything to support the main content; instead, they seem to directly contradict it with no clear explanation, which might confuse or communicate the opposite message to viewers.</p>
        <p>The infographics were made using Adobe Illustrator.</p>

        <h2>What's next?</h2>
        <h3>Hopefully more where that came from!</h3>
        <p>I had a fun time creating this infographic! It gave me valuable insight into the minds of a designer, an educator, and an informed citizen. Knowing how to communicate social issues clearly and effectively is something that concerns me because of the ways in which emotions and preconceived notions can often obfuscate rational discussions of important social topics. (I try to view this project not from the lens of a disinterested outsider, but as an empathetic listener&mdash;this allows me to explain debates fairly while recognizing my role as an always-implicated social agent.)</p>
        <p>I would, therefore, definitely be up to create more infographics clarifying important social issues in the future. Doing so would also serve as great opportunities to work on my visual/graphic design skills. This project taught me a lot about visual hierarchy and the importance of using contrast to order ideas.</p>
